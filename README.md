### Timeline

- Lab C: Build and save a map of the maze
- Before Class 7: Write code for initializing particle cloud and updating particles with motion model
- Lab D: Update particles with measurement model
- Before Class 8: Write code for normalizing particles, resampling them and updating the robot's pose
- Weekend before it's due: work with noise and perform some final corrections
